# Backup jobs

Borg + btrfs + systemd = <3

## Setup

```bash
make install 
vim /etc/pins2-backup # configure repo
make enable
```

## Update existing setup

```bash
make install
```

## Ideas

- Create daily bootable backup to internal HDD
	- systemd-unit bootable-backup.service, bootable-backup.timer
	- Init disk with same subvolumes
	- btrfs send receive all subvolumes
		target: @blubb/backup-2024-07-11
	- target: adjust /etc/fstab change subvol= mountpoints with @bla/backup-2024-07-11 subvols
	- target: change /boot/grub.cfg to use subvol=@/backup-2024-07-11 as root
	- target: change /boot/grub.cfg to use backup hdd uuid
	- target: clean up yesterdays snapshot
	- maybe change `with-system-snapshot` to keep track of 'locks' to prevent one concurrent `with-system-snapshot` calls to interfer with one another
		- keep track of it in a file? 
		```
		# /tmp/with-system-snapshot.locks
		# PID
		123123
		31231
		```

		when last one is removed, we remove the snapshot
